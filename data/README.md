# Data

This directory contains the data for the reproduced analysis from the story [Dear Mona, Whatâ€™s The Most Common Name In America?](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/whats-the-most-common-name-in-america/)

There are four input files that the original analysis used:

 * `state-pop.csv` - Total population and Hispanic population by state. 
 * `surnames.csv` - Data on surnames from the U.S. Census Bureau, including a breakdown by race/ethnicity. 
 * `aging-curve.csv` - Data from the Social Security Administration on the chances that someone born in the decade shown was still alive in 2013: http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_7.html
 * `adjustments.csv` - Taken directly from Lee Hartman's article: http://mypage.siu.edu/lhartman/johnsmith.html.

There are also five output files that the original analysis provided:

* `adjusted-name-combinations-list.csv` - Adjusted estimates for the most common full names. 
* `adjusted-name-combinations-matrix.csv` - The same data from the file `adjusted-name-combinations-list.csv` but in matrix form. These are the estimates presented in the second (and final) table of the article.
* `independent-name-combinations-by-pop.csv` - Matrix of estimates for the top 100 most common first names by top 100 most common surnames. These were calculated using independent odds, and displayed in the first table presented in the article.
* `new-top-firstNames.csv` - Final estimated ranking of top first names.
* `new-top-surnames.csv` - Final estimated ranking of top surnames.

We also included first name data from the SSA for the top 100 baby names for each decade from 1910-2010. These weren't provided as an input files, but the data was used in the original analysis as well as our reproduced analysis:

* `data1910-2020.csv` - Combined table of first name baby names from the SSA from each decade.
